# Discworld: A Victoria II Mod

![](screenshots/header_logo.png?raw=true)

## How to play:

Due to how Victoria II reads and processes mod files, you will need to follow these steps if you want to run the mod. This is especially true if you plan to play in Multiplayer, as not following some of these steps may cause inconsistant checksums!

### Download (via GitHub)

On the mod's Github page, click the **green, clone/download button** and select **Download ZIP**. *Do not use git to download/pull this mod if you want to play multiplayer*.

### Installation

- Extract ZIP into `steamapps\common\Victoria 2\mod` (If you do not have a mod folder, you may create it.)
- If it is not already named as such, rename the extracted folder to `the_discworld_project`
- Copy `discworld.mod` file out of the main folder and paste it into your mod folder.
- Rename your `history` file in `steamapps\common\Victoria 2` folder from `history` to `history_backup` (This will stop Victoria 2 from loading up the vanilla map.)
- Launch Victoria II and select `The Discworld Project`. You *may* need to relaunch a second time to get the proper checksum

### Additional Note:

Once you are done using this mod and would like to play others, disable this mod and rename the previously mentioned `history_backup` folder back to `history`
