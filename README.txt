due to how Victoria II replaces files currently you have to rename your vanillia history folder into something else when you run this mod,
i would suggest history_backup. if anyone knows how to fix this without making several thousand blank files let me know.

HOW TO DOWNLOAD FROM GITHUB:
click the green clone or download button and select download ZIP

INSTALLATION:
Extract this ZIP into steamapps\common\Victoria 2\mod
rename the extracted folder to the_discworld_project if it is not already named that
copy the discworld.mod file out of the main folder and paste it into your mod folder
rename steamapps\common\Victoria 2\history into something else
launch Victoria II and select "The Discworld Project"
